        <p>Pudding like strawberry cake with a decadent white chocolate frosting</p>
        <h3>Ingredents</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix</li>
            <li>1&frac12; cups of frozen sweetened strawberries, pureed</li>
            <li>12 ounces of cream cheese</li>
            <li>8 (1 ounce) squares of white chocolate</li>
            <li>1 cup of heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) container of frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
            <li>&frac12; pint of sliced fresh strawberries</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius). Grease two 9 inch round cake pans</li>
            <li>Make cake per directions except substitute the 1&frac12; cups of starwberries for the water and add 1 extra egg, (if cake mix calls for 2 eggs: add 3), and 8 ounces of the cream cheese at room temperature. Beat well and pour into the prepared pans.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius) for about 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Check if the cake is done by inserting a tootpick in the center, and if it comes out with the wet cake mixture, then it is not done. Let the cake cool fully before applying frosting.</li>
            <li>To make frosting: Heat the heavy cream until just beginning to boil. Pour it over the white chocolate (chopped) and the remaining 4 ounces cream cheese. Mix well and let it cool. Once cooled, fold into the whipped topping. Garnish with sliced fresh strawberries.</li>
        </ol>
