        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 thick slices of bacon</li>
            <li>1&frac12; teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup of chopped onion</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup of chopped carrots</li>
            <li>1 chopped stalk celery</li>
            <li>4 cups of low fat, low sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>4 cups of cubed potatoes</li>
            <li>&frac18; teaspoon of cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup of shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>&frac12; teaspoon of kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook bacon until it's crispy in a 3&frac14; saucepan, remove and drain well on paper towels. Discard bacon grease and wipe pan thoroughly with paper towel.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare vegetables. Add olive oil to saucepan and add onion, carrot, and celery as they are cut up. Saute until onion is soft but not brown, 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in chicken broth, potatoes, and pepper; bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, covered, until potatoes are tender, about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in cheese, heating just until melted--do not boil. Chop bacon and add it to the soup. Adjust seasoning to taste by adding salt, if desired.</li>
